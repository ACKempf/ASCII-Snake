# ASCII-Snake

## Introduction
ASCII snake is an adaptation of the famous snake game built to run on a command-line interface. The game works to demonstrate a TControl library that uses ANSI escape sequences and low-level terminal interface libraries to produce a grid of characters that can have any number of colors & 
format effects applied to them.

## Features
ASCII snake aims to recreate the snake game with additional modes, and a high-level of customization. Using the in-game settings menu the 
player is able to tweak the graphics, controls, and timing in any way they please. 

## Requirements
Currently ASCII snake requires a MACOS computer capable of running the terminal application.

## Installation
ASCII snake (when compiled) is an entirely portable executable file, depending on no external or non-standard libraries or files, and can be ran from anywhere on a MACOS system.
