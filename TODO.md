## TO-DO List

### 1. Create a library with macOS-Specific Functions
- [ ] Set up a separate library project for macOS-specific functions.
- [ ] Implement basic functions (ex. terminal screen clearing, cursor movement? keyboard input handling?).
- [ ] Test the library functions on macOS to ensure compatibility and functionality.

### 2. Develop Game Mechanics
- [ ] Implement Tetris grid.
- [ ] Create and display Tetromino shapes within the grid.
- [ ] Implement boundary detection to prevent Tetriminos from moving beyond the grid boundaries.
- [ ] Implement collision detection to detect when Tetriminos collide with other Tetriminos or the boundaries.
- [ ] Allow rotation of Tetriminos while ensuring they do not collide with other Tetriminos or the boundaries.
- [ ] Implement Tetrimino movement speed control, adjusting how quickly Tetriminos fall down the grid.

### 3. Develop Game Logic
- [ ] Implement a mechanism to control the speed of Tetrimino descent.
- [ ] game states (ex. playing, paused, game over).
- [ ] Implement game over detection to end the game when Tetriminos reach the top of the grid.
- [ ] Implement scoring mechanism based on cleared rows(?).
- [ ] Implement level progression(?)
- [ ] Implement statistics screen (shows the amount of times each tetrimino has been placed on the grid during the game)

### 4. Miscellaneous
- [ ] Add settings menu with options (expand on this later).
- [ ] Add color (Background and tetromino)
- [ ] Add music(?)
- [ ] Implement file to log and save high scores(?)
- [ ] Add support for Windows
